## Visual Studio Code
This is the user configurations of my VSC setup.

Navigate to the settings pane by `cmd + ,` and simply copy and paste its contents there.

### Font
In the folder `JetBrainsMono-2` there is a custom font that has ligatures.

### Icon
There is an icon file in this folder. This is the current (and best) icon for VSC I have found.
