Storage for config back-ups and custom scripts

In order to use the `balance` script, you need to do two things:

1. Provide a JSON file containing your Spendee credentials:

```JSON
{
  "email": "john@doe.com",
  "password": "your password"
}
```

2. Install the Spendee Python API wrapper

```Bash
pip install spendee
```
